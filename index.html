        <span class="greeting">Howdy!</span> Welcome to my website. My
        name is Robert, and I am a computer science major at Texas A&M
        University. Engineering has always been an integral part of my 
        life, and it is important to me that I continue to kindle this
        flame by challenging myself both within and beyond the classroom.
        I hope to share this passion with you here.
