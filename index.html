          <span class="greeting">Howdy!</span> Welcome to my website. My
          name is Robert, and I am a computer science major at Texas A&M
          University. Engineering has always been an integral part of my 
          life, and it is important to me that I continue to kindle this
          flame by challenging myself both within and beyond the classroom.
          I hope to share this passion with you here.
