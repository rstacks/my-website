          Howdy! Welcome to my website. I am a sophomore computer science
          major at Texas A&M University. Engineering has always been an
          integral part of my life, and it is important to me that I continue
          to hone my skills by challenging myself both within and beyond
          the classroom. I hope to share my efforts with you here.
        </p>

          In addition to providing general information about me,
          this website serves as a repository of my personal accomplishments
          and endeavors. Feel free to explore my pages using the navigation
          bar above. My goal is for you to have a good idea of what I
          am capable of by the end of your visit.

          <h3 class="about-me-subheading">Background</h3>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in The Woodlands, Texas. My father
            spent most of his life in Texas, too, but my mother hails
            from Thailand. This, of course, makes me half Thai! My
            family and I visit Thailand often to spend time with
            relatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended the Academy of Science and Technology at The
            Woodlands College Park High School. I competed in science
            fairs throughout my time there, earning several awards
            along the way. The process of developing research
            projects and presenting them to teachers, peers, and
            industry professionals was grueling at times, but I
            consider science fair to be one of my most valuable
            academic experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was always intrigued by technology, but taking
            computer science electives in high school and incorporating
            that knowledge into some of my science fair projects are
            what solidified my choice to pursue further study in the
            field. Now, as a college student, I am excited to build my
            skills and apply them in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started playing the trombone in intermediate school, and 
            I have yet to put my horn down. I was a member of my high
            school's wind ensemble and a section leader in our marching
            band. Today, I play the trombone for the University Symphonic
            Band at Texas A&M.
          </p>
          <p class="ending-paragraph">
            Beyond that, I enjoy editing videos (usually skits starring
            me and/or my friends) and finishing 3D printed models. I
            recently finished painting a clone trooper helmet from Star 
            Wars that I am quite proud of.
